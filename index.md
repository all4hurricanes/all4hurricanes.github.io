**About This Page**

Hello! I’m Kurt, I research subseasonal prediction of tropical cyclones. I made this page to share forecasts and analysis. Right below you’ll see my seasonal and subseasonal forecasts for this season as well as an explanation on how I made these predictions. If you want to know more about me or my research check out my personal info further down.

**2021 Seasonal Forecast**

![Cumulative ACE Forecast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37673640/130290543-568ada79-8fba-4c2f-8d4c-dd1438204727.png)
![Five Day ACE Forecast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37673640/129232331-67915b14-ccef-4451-a433-71293602444e.png)

*These seasonal forecasts are made based on the linear regression of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the main development region in the Atlantic and the SSTs in the Niño-3.4 region of the pacific. Accumulated cyclone energy or ACE is a measure of tropical cyclone activity that incorporates the intensity and longevity of a storm, it is essentially an integral of the squared maximum wind speed over time. Predictions, climatology and observed values of ACE are all based on tropical cyclone activity south of 30°N.*


**Aug 3 2021 Subseasonal Forecast**

![Subseasonal ACE Forecast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37673640/129232586-309d1ee0-49a4-4e91-b323-9470cd130542.png)

*This plot is like the seasonal forecast but it incorporates two other predictors, vertical wind shear and the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), that (hopefully) improve the predictions out to 20 days. Yellow bars indicate the expected ACE from the seasonal forecast and green bars indicate the expected ACE from the subseasonal forecast. The red line indicates climatological ACE. The blue percentages indicate the odds of an above average period in terms of ACE anomalies according to the subseasonal forecast.
The linear model was built on reanalysis data and assumes the predictions of shear and MJO are prefect (which they are definitely not). I am working on incorporating a linear model that incorporates the errors in predictions of these parameters. Shear forecast comes from the Navy-ESPC and MJO data from the [ECMWF ensemble forecast](https://apps.ecmwf.int/webapps/opencharts/products/mofc_multi_mjo_family_index).*


# Research

My work is in subseasonal variability and prediction of tropical cyclone activity including MJO-ENSO interactions, evaluation of genesis indices and prediction with NESM, CCSM4 and ECMWF models. I am a 5th year Ph.D student working with Sharan Majumdar and Ben Kirtman.

**Outreach**

I am one of the authors of the “Seasoned Chaos” blog. This blog is founded by Ben Kirtmann's graduate students and aims to educate the public about recent research and topics related to subseasonal prediction. [Here](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/) is the Seasoned Chaos homepage. 

I am part of Canes on Canes an outreach group at RSMAS. We teach hurricane preparedness and science to a variety of audiences from elementary schools to business professionals. Check out a recording of our biggest event [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VKOYdmWM5I)

I've also done outreach as a part of climate group at the Miami Youth Climate Summits.
