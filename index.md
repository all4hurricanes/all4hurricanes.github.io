**About This Page**

Hello! I’m Kurt, I research subseasonal prediction of tropical cyclones. I made this page to share forecasts and analysis. Right below you’ll see my seasonal and subseasonal forecasts for this season as well as an explanation on how I made these predictions. If you want to know more about me or my research check out my personal info further down.

**2020 Seasonal Forecast**

*These seasonal forecasts are made based on the linear regression of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the main development region in the Atlantic and the SSTs in the Niño-3.4 region of the pacific. Accumulated cyclone energy or ACE is a measure of tropical cyclone activity that incorporates the intensity and longevity of a storm, it is essentially an integral of the squared maximum wind speed over time. Predictions, climatology and observed values of ACE are all based on tropical cyclone activity south of 30°N.*


**Aug 25 Subseasonal Forecast**

*This plot is like the seasonal forecast but it incorporates two other predictors, vertical wind shear and the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), that (hopefully) improve the predictions out to 15 days. However, the linear model was built on reanalysis data and assumes the predictions of shear and MJO are prefect (which they are definitely not). I am working on creating a linear model that incorporates the errors in predictions of these parameters. Shear forecast comes from the Navy-ESPC and MJO data from the [GFS ensemble forecast](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/MJO/mjo.shtml).*


# Research

My work is in subseasonal variability and prediction of tropical cyclone activity including MJO-ENSO interactions, evaluation of genesis indices and prediction with NESM, CCSM4 and ECMWF models. I am a 5th year Ph.D student working with Sharan Majumdar and Ben Kirtmann.

**Outreach**

I am one of the authors of the “Seasoned Chaos” blog. This blog is founded by Ben Kirtmann's graduate students and aims to educate the public about recent research and topics related to subseasonal prediction. [Here](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/) is the Seasoned Chaos homepage. 

I am part of Canes on Canes an outreach group at RSMAS. We teach hurricane preparedness and science to a variety of audiences from elementary schools to business professionals. Check out a recording of our biggest event [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VKOYdmWM5I)

I've also done outreach as a part of climate group at the Miami Youth Climate Summits.
