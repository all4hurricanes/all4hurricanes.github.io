**2020 Seasonal Forecast**

These seasonal forecasts are made based on the linear regression of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the main development region in the Atlantic and the SSTs in the Niño-3.4 region of the pacific. Predictions, climatology and observed values of accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) are all based on tropical cyclone activity south of 30°N.

**Aug 18 Subseasonal Forecast**

Coming soon, see twitter for a sneak peak. 


**Research**


My work is in subseasonal variability and prediction of tropical cyclone activity including MJO-ENSO interactions, evaluation of genesis indices and prediction with NESM, CCSM4 and ECMWF models.

**Outreach**

I am a contributing author to the “Seasoned Chaos” blog. The blog is founded by Ben Kirtmann graduate students and aims to educate the public about recent research and topics related to subseasonal prediction. [Here](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/) is the Seasoned Chaos homepage. 

I am part of Canes on Canes an outreach group at RSMAS, we teach hurricane preparedness and science to a variety of audiences from elementary schools to business professionals. Check out a recording of our biggest event [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VKOYdmWM5I)

I've also done outreach as a part of climate group at the Miami Youth Climate Summits.
